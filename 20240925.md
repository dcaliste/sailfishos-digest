# Repository roundup

Besides some usual library updates and some interesting minor changes like a prefix-based phone number filtering capability or the device not re-notifying unread SMS on device restart, branches named `upgrade-5.0.0` appeared in some repositories. This means that the version 5.0.0 is considered stable enough by the team to get tested internally as a whole distribution and already got fixes for regressions or bugs during these internal tests.

## Network and telephony stack

* `sofia-sip`, a SIP library, **direc85** [updated it to 1.13.17](https://github.com/sailfishos/sofia-sip/pull/3).

* `openvpn`, a VPN solution, **direc85** [updated it to 2.6.12](https://github.com/sailfishos/openvpn/pull/6).

* `connman`, the connection manager, in order to avoid blocking `vpnd` when network is not properly connected, **Laakkonenjussi** proposed to [resolve the DNS with GResolve first](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/76) and fallback to `getaddrinfo()` later. **Laakkonenjussi** also [fixed the shutdown process](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/77) in case of WireGuard VPN.

* `voicecall`, the open source part of the calling application, **dcaliste** completed the incoming call filter plugin by [extending it with prefix matching](https://github.com/sailfishos/voicecall/pull/20). **pvuorela** [labelled ongoing call records with a `.tmp` extension](https://github.com/sailfishos/voicecall/pull/21) since wave files got their metadata on completion and are not readable without them.

It will never be observed for changes after it has been created.

* `commhistory-daemon`, the daemon handling call and message history, **pvuorela** [avoided notifications (of SMS of missed calls) to be notified again](https://github.com/sailfishos/commhistory-daemon/pull/20) on service (or device) restart.

* `crash-reporter`, a tool to report application crashes, **pvuorela** [replaced calls to `qdbus` by `dbus-send`](https://github.com/sailfishos/crash-reporter/pull/57) which allow not to install `qt5-qtwidgets` and `qt5-qttools-qdbus` packages.
