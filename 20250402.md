# Repository roundup

## Web browsing

* `sailfish-browser`, the browser itself, **pvuorela** [fixed the history button visibility](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1109) that sometimes became visible under certain conditions within the security info page. He also used [a different icon](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1110) to represent the state "always ask" from the state "deny" when indicating the permission exception of a page. **rainemak** is working on making the cover content to avoid relayouting and [adjust itself in landscape orientation](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1111) for small device form factors.

## Network, communication and telephony stack

* `wpa_supplicant`, for accessing WPA and WPA2 protected WiFi networks, **mal** [protected the use of a specific attribute](https://github.com/sailfishos/wpa_supplicant/pull/10) (`NL80211_ATTR_SOCKET_OWNER`) for kernels older than 3.16, so such devices can still connect to Wifi.

* `qtbase`, the Qt library, **direc85** added [handling for permanent redirection](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtbase/pull/20) (HTTP response 308).

* `bluez5`, the Linux Bluetooth stack, **mal** proposed to [update it to 5.80](https://github.com/sailfishos/bluez5/pull/14).

* `messagingframework`, the email Qt framework, **dcaliste** fixed upstream [some IMAP account creation issues](https://github.com/sailfishos/messagingframework/pull/44), faced by UBports ; and also moved internally the mail data store IPC, from an opaque QDataStream implementation to properly defined D-Bus signals and arguments.

* `connman`, the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** fixed the issue that [WireGuard would not work if the endpoint (hostname) is a FQDN](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/99). Work is under progress to [replace the internal `dnsproxy.c` usage](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/100) with functionalities provided by `systemd-resolved`.

* `telepathy-ring`, Ofono plugin for Telepathy, **mal** is working on [making the ringback tone works](https://github.com/sailfishos/telepathy-ring/pull/5) for modems that require it after an outgoing call has entered the alerting state.

## Multimedia

* `libtheora`, Theora video compression codec, **mal** [updated it to 1.2.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/libtheora/pull/3).

* `libsndfile`, a library for reading and writing sound files, **mal** [updated it to latest master branch](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsndfile/pull/5). This brings the upstream fix for CVE-2024-50612.

## Main interface

* `crash-reporter`, a tool to report application crashes, **direc85** added [an option to save debugging information after a crash in the home partition](https://github.com/sailfishos/crash-reporter/pull/59), to avoid filling up the root partition. It required [some changes in `sp-rich-core`](https://github.com/sailfishos/sp-rich-core/pull/99). With this possibility to use the home partition, [the file limit has been increased to 2GB](https://github.com/sailfishos/sp-rich-core/pull/100), which allows to capture information for the main interface (`lipstick`) crashes for instance.

* `sailfish-office`, the document application, **pvuorela** [adjusted the SparQL calls](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-office/pull/196) to the newer versions from (former) Tracker.

* `ngfd`, the non graphical feedback daemon handling sound and vibration feedback, **spiiroin** [fixed crashes due to stale timers](https://github.com/sailfishos/ngfd/pull/16).

## Low level libraries

* `mce`, mode control entity, **spiiroin** fixed the [issues reported by `scan-build`](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/40) from `clang`.

* `buteo-syncfw`, the framework handling synchronisation, **pvuorela** [removed the build dependency](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-syncfw/pull/24) on `usb-moded`. It is only used by SyncML from `buteo-sync-plugins`, but actually not used in Sailfish OS.

* `dsme`, device state management entity, **FakeShell** [fixed a compilation issue](https://github.com/sailfishos/dsme/pull/9) in a module actually not used in Sailfish OS.

* `lxc`, Linux resource containers, **mal** [updated it to 6.0.3](https://github.com/sailfishos/lxc/pull/6).

* `libxslt`, the XML toolkit, **mal** [updated it to 1.1.43](https://github.com/sailfishos/libxslt/pull/5).

## Developer's corner

* `libsdl-gfx`, the simple direct media layer - graphics primitives, **pvuorela** fixed [a permission issue](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsdl-gfx/pull/4) in packaging on the dynamic library.

* `gstreamer`, a multimedia framework, **mal** fixed in packaging another [permission issue on `gst-ptp-helper` tool](https://github.com/sailfishos/gstreamer/pull/10).

* `shadow-utils`, used to manage the the shadow password files, **mal** changed the packaging so [some utils get the set-user-ID mode](https://github.com/sailfishos/shadow-utils/pull/6) (meaning that when executed by a normal user, they are running with root privileges).

* `nemo-qml-plugin-dbus`, QML bindings for DBus, **pvuorela** fixed [a permission issue on a text file](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-dbus/pull/19) (used for tests), making it executable.

* `nemo-keepalive`, CPU and display keepalive and scheduling library, **pvuorela** [added the executable permission](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-keepalive/pull/8) on the dynamic library `libkeepalive-glib.so`.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-email`, QML bindings for emails, **pvuorela** merged the possibility to [get the package running offline for testing purposes](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-email/pull/29). Previously, it was specifically compiled in a separated package.

* `cargo-packaging`, macros and tools to assist with cargo and rust packaging, **direc85** pushed [version 1.2.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/cargo-packaging) to this new repository.

* `cargo-auditable`, a tool to embed auditing information in ELF sections of rust binaries, **direc85** pushed [version 0.6.4](https://github.com/sailfishos/cargo-auditable) to this new repository.

* `cargo-c`, a helper to build and install c-like libraries from Rust, **direc85 pushed [version 0.9.31](https://github.com/sailfishos/cargo-c) to this new repository.
