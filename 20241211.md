# Repository roundup

## Network and telephony stack

## Multimedia

* `droidmedia`, Android media wrapper library, **mal** [added missing functions to compile on top of Lineage 21](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/pull/129).

* `libsdl`, a multimedia library, **mal** [upgraded it to 2.30.10](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsdl/pull/7).

* `gstreamer`, a multimedia framework, **mal** [upgraded to the latest upstream version 1.24.10](https://github.com/sailfishos/gstreamer/pull/9). The various plugins were also upgraded accordingly.

## Main interface

* `sensorfw`, sensor framework, **spiiroin** added a [work-around for C2 accelerometer freezes](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/27) (making orientation locked). For reference, this freeze may happen when gyeroscopes are disabled. Enabling again the gyroscopes with a different data rate, reenables again the accelerometers.

* `ngfd`, the non graphical feedback daemon handling sound and vibration feedback, **pvuorela** [corrected a warning about not being able to connect to the session bus](https://github.com/sailfishos/ngfd/pull/13). He also [fixed a crash when using `ffmemless` to play a sound](https://github.com/sailfishos/ngfd/pull/14), thanks to **nephros** reproducer.

## Low level libraries

* `ssu`, the seamless software updater, **pvuorela** [fixed failing unit tests](https://github.com/sailfishos/ssu/pull/24) and other clean-ups.

* `shared-mime-info`, the Freedesktop MIME info database, **pvuorela** [fixed packaging issues introduced when moving to `meson` build system](https://github.com/sailfishos/shared-mime-info/pull/4), resulting in a lot of file under `/usr/share/mime/` without owner.

* `libuser`, a user and group account administration library, **pvuorela** [updated it to 0.64](https://github.com/sailfishos/libuser/pull/2).

* `pulseaudio`, the sound daemon and much more, **jusa** [allowed to read configuration files from a subdirectory](https://github.com/sailfishos/pulseaudio/pull/8) (`default.pa.d`). It makes it easier to provide additional configuration files from different sources.

* `PackageKit`, a D-Bus abstraction layer that allows the session user, **pvuorela** [fixed a crash and a memory leak](https://github.com/sailfishos/PackageKit/pull/4).

## Developer's corner

**pvuorela** updated packaging `spec` files in various repositories, favouring macros like `%make_build`, removing deprecated ones like `%defattr`, removing group declaration or updating source URL:

* `fingerterm`, the console application, **pvuorela** [avoided warnings for devices without corners](https://github.com/sailfishos/fingerterm/pull/11) (value is undefined in such cases).

* `rust-cbindgen`, utilities to create C/C++11 headers for Rust libraries, **mal** proposed to [update it to 0.23.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/rust-cbindgen/pull/8).

* `busybox`, a single binary which includes versions of a large number of system commands, **rainemak** [enabled `realpath`](https://github.com/sailfishos/busybox/pull/11) (a utility to resolve the absolute path of a file).
