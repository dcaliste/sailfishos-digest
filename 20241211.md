# Repository roundup

## Network, communication and telephony stack

* `wpa_supplicant`, a set of tools to allow connections to WPA protected wifi networks, **Laakkonenjussi** [added patches to address the non-stopped scheduled scan](https://github.com/sailfishos/wpa_supplicant/pull/9) by sending the results after a timeout and stopping the scan itself. According to the pull request message : it seems to make the black network-issue on C2 to disappear.

* `nfcd`, the daemon for near field communication, **pvuorela** [removed reading the locale from the old `nemo/locale.conf` directory](https://github.com/sailfishos/nfcd/pull/20).

## Multimedia

* `droidmedia`, Android media wrapper library, **mal** [added missing functions to compile on top of Lineage 21](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/pull/129).

* `libsdl`, a multimedia library, **mal** [upgraded it to 2.30.10](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsdl/pull/7).

* `gstreamer`, a multimedia framework, **mal** [upgraded to the latest upstream version 1.24.10](https://github.com/sailfishos/gstreamer/pull/9). The various plugins were also upgraded accordingly.

* `gecko-camera`, a plugin-based library for Gecko to simplify video capture, **mal** fixed [some issues reported by `cppcheck` tool](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-camera/pull/12), and [also in `gst-droid`](https://github.com/sailfishos/gst-droid/pull/82).

## Browser stack

* `qtmozembed`, Qt bindings for the Gecko engine, **mal** [fixed tab view generation when in landscape orientation](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtmozembed/pull/54).

## Main interface

* `sensorfw`, sensor framework, **spiiroin** added a [work-around for C2 accelerometer freezes](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/27) (making orientation locked). For reference, this freeze may happen when gyeroscopes are disabled. Enabling again the gyroscopes with a different data rate, reenables again the accelerometers.

* `ngfd`, the non graphical feedback daemon handling sound and vibration feedback, **pvuorela** [corrected a warning about not being able to connect to the session bus](https://github.com/sailfishos/ngfd/pull/13). He also [fixed a crash when using `ffmemless` to play a sound](https://github.com/sailfishos/ngfd/pull/14), thanks to **nephros** reproducer.

* `minui`, a library for minimal UI framebuffer applications, **pvuorela** [implemented two fixes](https://github.com/sailfishos/minui/pull/9) : one picked from upstream that waits for page flip completion before calling `drmModePageFlip()` again, another one that implements retries when `drm_init()` fails.

* `lipstick`, the home screen code (open source parts), **pvuorela** [added a way to control when a back event is sent to the UI](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/57).

## Low level libraries

* `ssu`, the seamless software updater, **pvuorela** [fixed failing unit tests](https://github.com/sailfishos/ssu/pull/24) and other clean-ups.

* `shared-mime-info`, the Freedesktop MIME info database, **pvuorela** [fixed packaging issues introduced when moving to `meson` build system](https://github.com/sailfishos/shared-mime-info/pull/4), resulting in a lot of file under `/usr/share/mime/` without owner.

* `libuser`, a user and group account administration library, **pvuorela** [updated it to 0.64](https://github.com/sailfishos/libuser/pull/2).

* `pulseaudio`, the sound daemon and much more, **jusa** [allowed to read configuration files from a subdirectory](https://github.com/sailfishos/pulseaudio/pull/8) (`default.pa.d`). It makes it easier to provide additional configuration files from different sources.

* `PackageKit`, a D-Bus abstraction layer that allows the session user, **pvuorela** [fixed a crash and a memory leak](https://github.com/sailfishos/PackageKit/pull/4).

* `dsme`, device state management entity, **spiiroin** [fixed the arguments exposed in introspection](https://github.com/sailfishos/dsme/pull/7) in the function inhibiting shutdown.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings`, QML bindings to access system parameters, **pvuorela** [replaced a blocking D-Bus call with an asynchronous equivalent](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings/pull/47) to get the maximum brightness supported by the device.

* `mesa`, graphic libraries, **mal** [backported a patch to create symlinks for DRI](https://github.com/sailfishos/mesa/pull/5).

* `alsa-lib`, the library to handle the sound using the ALSA interface, **mal** [updated it to 1.2.13](https://github.com/sailfishos/alsa-lib/pull/2).

* `wayland`, Wayland compositor, **mal** [updated it to 1.23.1](https://github.com/sailfishos/wayland/pull/3).

* `wayland-protocols`, Wayland protocols that adds functionality not available in the core protocol, **mal** [updated them to 1.38](https://github.com/sailfishos/wayland-protocols/pull/3).

* `qtbase`, the Qt framework, and the networking part in particular, **mal** [switched to use `private-code` when using wayland-scanner](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtbase/pull/19) in the scripts used by CMake to detect Wayland capabilities and did the same in [`qtwayland`](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtwayland/pull/4) also. This lokks like a new requirement after upgrading `wayland` to the latest version.

* `ssu-sysinfo`, tools and libraries for getting ssu information, it is possible that device hardware has changes that software needs to take into account. **spiiroin** [introduced `ssusysinfo_pcba_version()` function](https://github.com/sailfishos/ssu-sysinfo/pull/6) that reads version information from `/sys/firmware/devicetree/base/model` file.
