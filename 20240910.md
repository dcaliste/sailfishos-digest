# Repository roundup

As reported on [Flypig's blog](https://www.flypig.co.uk/gecko), his huge work on moving to a newer engine for the native browser, started to get merged in the Sailfish OS repositories, also with the help of other contributors. The user facing part of the telephony stack received the [ability to filter out incoming calls](https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/request-internal-call-and-sms-blocklist/2067/75). And last but not least, one can notice that **direc85** has now write access to the official repositories, which means he's working directly for Jollyboys. LLVM, Rust and other packages were upgraded thanks to his work as a contributor and he started his new public tasks by upgrading various low level libraries.

## Network and telephony stack

* `wpa_supplicant`, for accessing WPA and WPA2 protected WiFi networks, **Laakkonenjussi** [updated it to 2.11](https://github.com/sailfishos/wpa_supplicant/pull/6).

* `voicecall`, the open source part of the calling application, **dcaliste** added a new API in the voice call manager to [filter incoming calls](https://github.com/sailfishos/voicecall/pull/15). The pull request also contains a minimal plugin to the manager that block incoming calls based on a blacklist stored in DConf. While the current implementation only supports exact number matching, he proposed to [extend it with prefix matching](https://github.com/sailfishos/voicecall/pull/20).

* `commhistory-daemon`, the daemon handling call and message history, **dcaliste** [adjusted the miss call notification](https://github.com/sailfishos/commhistory-daemon/pull/17) so it does not appear for blocked calls. **pvuorela** [deleted some left over code](https://github.com/sailfishos/commhistory-daemon/pull/18) about contact access authorisation and also [removed unnecessary use of `qtcontacts-sqlite`](https://github.com/sailfishos/commhistory-daemon/pull/19).

## Native browser

* `gecko-dev`, Mozilla's Gecko web rendering engine, **flypig** [updated the submodule mirror to ESR 91 and added patches for building for Sailfish OS](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/162). The pull request is currently under discussion and is targetting a dedicated branch.

* `qtmozembed`, Qt bindings for the Gecko engine, **flypig** got his changes in to [support the engine upgrade to ESR 91](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtmozembed/pull/49). This is currently merged in a dedicated branch.

* `embedlite-components`, QML components for the browser, **flypig** pushed his work [changes to support ESR 91](https://github.com/sailfishos/embedlite-components/pull/100). Following wider testing of ESR 91, **b100dian** proposed a patch to [workaround invalid certificates](https://github.com/sailfishos/embedlite-components/pull/101) by allowing them temporarily.

## Multimedia framework

* `droidmedia`, Android media wrapper library, **mal** added [support for Android 14 APIs](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/pull/127). **Michal-Szczepaniak** proposed a [workaround for Motorola G2 display issues](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/pull/128).

## Low level libraries

* `dsme`, device state management entity, **jmlich** fixed [compiling issues when using a new GCC](https://github.com/sailfishos/dsme/pull/5).

* `ohm`, the open hardware manager (OHM), **jmlich** fixed [compiling issues on Manjaro](https://github.com/sailfishos/ohm/pull/2).

* `qtcontacts-sqlite`, SQLite-based plugin for QtPIM contacts, **pvuorela** pushed [some cleanups](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtcontacts-sqlite/pull/8), including avoiding to expose some internal details with the installed headers.

* `libcommhistory`, the library to access SMS/phone history, **pvuorela** [moved as internal the contact resolution](https://github.com/sailfishos/libcommhistory/pull/16), so `libcommhistory` is not exposing `qtcontacts-sqlite` headers.

* `sqlite`, an embeddable SQL database engine, **direc85** [updated it to 3.46.1](https://github.com/sailfishos/sqlite/pull/5).

* `libxml2`, an XML parsing library, **direc85** [updated it to 2.13.3](https://github.com/sailfishos/libxml2/pull/5).

* `xslt`, the XML toolkit, **direc85** [updated it to 1.1.42](https://github.com/sailfishos/libxslt/pull/4).

* `curl`, the command-line tool to access the web, **direc85** [updated it to 8.9.1](https://github.com/sailfishos/curl/pull/6).
