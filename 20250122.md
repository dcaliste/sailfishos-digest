# Repository roundup

While the [e-mail messaging framework](https://codereview.qt-project.org/q/project:qt-labs/messagingframework), also known as QMF, has been developped under the Qt umbrella for a long time, nowadays Sailfish OS is (almost) the only user of this reprository. Recently, people from UBPorts have started working on packaging the repository for Debian and are contributing various fix and changes upstream. Indeed, [Dekko](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://open-store.io/app/dekko2.dekkoproject) is an e-mail client used in Ubuntu Touch and is internally based on an old fork of QMF. Guido Berhoerster and Mike Gabriel are now migrating it to use the same upstream version of QMF as Sailfish OS is using. This convergence should be profitable for both projects and one should see more issues fixed in the coming future in QMF.

## Network, communication and telephony stack

* `messagingframework`, the email Qt framework, **dcaliste** [upstreamed the patch adding support for credentials](https://github.com/sailfishos/messagingframework/pull/20) provided by the single sign-on framework. He also proposed to [simplify how SMTP capabilities are fetched for new accounts](https://github.com/sailfishos/messagingframework/pull/28). **pvuorela** made [a list of pending jobs](https://github.com/sailfishos/messagingframework/issues/29) to coordinate actions.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-email`, QML bindings for emails, since the message server is now exposing a service over D-Bus, **pvuorela** [removed the check on a lock file](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-email/pull/24) to know if the server is running but check the existence of the service instead.

## Low level libraries

* `cryptsetup`, a utility for setting up encrypted disks, **pvuorela** [upgraded it to 2.7.5](https://github.com/sailfishos/cryptsetup/pull/2).

* `glib2`, the Glib library from GTK / Gnome, **pvuorela** found and [fixed an issue with time zone definition](https://github.com/sailfishos/glib2/pull/6) when several symlinks are used to point to the time zone data file. This issue made the gallery application to display wrong dates for images and photographs.

* `sensorfw`, sensor framework, **spiiroin** added [support for wake-up sensors](https://github.com/sailfishos/sensorfw/pull/29) from libhybris. For devices that support wake-up events, this allows to notify the OS when the device is picked-up, shaked, glanced at...

* `mce`, mode control entity, **spiiroin** enabled low power mode based on wake-up sensors. From the commit message, "as LPM display is opt-in, also this feature is disabled by default and needs to be enabled from command line [with] `mcetool --set-wakeup-sensor-mode=enabled` or via corresponding mce configuration file entry `/system/osso/dsm/display/wakeup_sensor_enabled=true`. This is working for Jolla C2 at least.

## Developer's corner

* `git`, the famous version control, **mal** [updated it to 2.48.1](https://github.com/sailfishos/git/pull/10).

* `net-tools`, basic networking tools, including `ifconfig`, `netstat`, `route`, ..., **mal** is working [on a upgrade to 2.10](https://github.com/sailfishos/net-tools/pull/1).

* `buteo-mtp`, an MTP library, **pvuorela** [fixed unit-test issues](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-mtp/pull/15).

* `udisks2`, the udisks daemon serves as an interface to system block devices, **pvuorela** is working on [upgrading it to 2.10.1](https://github.com/sailfishos/udisks2/pull/11). It requires some upgrades in `libblockdev` also.

* `libblockdev`, a library for low-level manipulation with block devices, **pvuorela** is proposing to [move to version 3.2.1](https://github.com/sailfishos/libblockdev/pull/2) to allow the upgrade of `udisks2`. It requires to add two new repositories, for `kyutils` dn `libnvme`.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings`, QML bindings to access system parameters, **pvuorela** [adjusted the code](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings/pull/48) for the upgrade in `udisks2`.

* `filesystem`, the basic directory layout for a Linux system, **direc85** is proposing to [rework the packaging](https://github.com/sailfishos/filesystem/pull/2), fixing warnings and packaging errors.

* `meego-rpm-config`, specific rpm configuration files for Sailfish OS, **direc85** [rewrote the loop inside `brp-compress`](https://github.com/sailfishos/meego-rpm-config/pull/8) so RPM build speed can be increased for packages with a lot of directories like `filesystem`.

* `sharutils`, the GNU shar utilities for packaging and unpackaging shell archives, **mal** [updated the package to 4.15.2](https://github.com/sailfishos/sharutils/pull/1).

* `ssu`, the seamless software updater, **keto** [resetted the domain when unregistering](https://github.com/sailfishos/ssu/pull/25) and added a way to unregister from command-line.

:* `rsync`, a synchronisation command line tool, **mal** [updated it to 3.4.1](https://github.com/sailfishos/rsync/pull/6).
