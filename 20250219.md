# Repository roundup

## Browser stack

* `gecko-dev`, Mozilla's Gecko web rendering engine, **mal** fixed an issue [making impossible to enter search terms in the address bar](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/170).

* `qtmozembed`, Qt bindings for the Gecko engine, **pvuorela** proposed to [move code related to the virtual keyboard height](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtmozembed/pull/56) directly where it is [used in `sailfish-browser`](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtmozembed/pull/56).

## Network, communication and telephony stack

* `buteo-sync-plugin-carddav`, a plugin for synchronising contacts, **lduboeuf** fixed an issue in the plug-in, [not notifying the daemon on authentication error](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-carddav/pull/7). **pvuorela** [cleaned up the spec file](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-carddav/pull/8) used to generate the RPM package.

* `buteo-syncfw`, the framework handling synchronisation, **dcaliste** [added the synchronisation status codes](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-syncfw/pull/21) to the QML `SyncProfileWatcher` objects. **pvuorela** [clarified the method used to get the status of external synchronisation](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-syncfw/pull/22): Buteo plug-ins are responsible of the periodic synchronisation of their sources, like calendar or e-mails. But some sources may take back this responsability, like the e-mail in case of always up-to-date IMAP folders.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-connectivity`, QML bindings for network connectivity, **LaakkonenJussi** [serialised WireGuard addresses and allowed IPs to strings](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-connectivity/pull/16) so they can be inserted in the settings of VPN models.

* `connman`, the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** [added support for configurations in a sub-directory](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/88) `conf.d`. A fix for [Mullvad configuration files](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/93) was set up. **LaakkonenJussi** also worked on [exposing tethering client IPs over D-Bus](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/91) and [added corresponding informations in `libconnman-qt`](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/39).

## Main interface

* `lipstick`, the home screen code (open source parts), **pvuorela** [fixed a memory leak on right mouse button click](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/63).

* `mapplauncherd`, the daemon responsible to start applications faster thanks to preloading, **sertonix** [fixed building with `ninja`](https://github.com/sailfishos/mapplauncherd/pull/17). **pvuorela** [corrected a wrong cast](https://github.com/sailfishos/mapplauncherd/pull/18) between signed and unsigned integers.

## Low level libraries

* `timed`, time and alarm handling daemon, **pvuorela** [fixed potential memory leaks](https://github.com/sailfishos/timed/pull/12).

* `ngfd`, the non graphical feedback daemon handling sound and vibration feedback, **pvuorela** [fixed compiler warning with Clang](https://github.com/sailfishos/ngfd/pull/15).

* `libtasn1`, the ASN.1 library used in GNUTLS, **mal** [updated it to 4.20](https://github.com/sailfishos/libtasn1/pull/3).

* `sailjail`, a wrapper around firejail, **pvuorela** [fixed potential issues detected by static analysis](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailjail/pull/79).

* `mce`, a framework exposing hardware status of display, buttonsâ€¦, **PureTryOut** updated the [build system for systemd files](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/37) to be installed following the PREFIX. **pvuorela** [fixed a memnotify call](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/38).

* `dsme`, device state management entity, **pvuorela** and **spiiroin** [fixed a memory leak](https://github.com/sailfishos/dsme/pull/8).

## Developer's corner

* `openssl`, utilities and library for cryptography, **pvuorela** [cleaned up the spec file](https://github.com/sailfishos/openssl/pull/8), removing the now unused Perl dependency. **mal** [updated it to 1.1.1w](https://github.com/sailfishos/openssl/pull/9).

* `ninja`, a small build system with a focus on speed, **mal** [avoided a dependency on `cmake`](https://github.com/sailfishos/ninja/pull/3) to ease the bottstraping of the stack (`cmake` can use `ninja`).

* `issue-tracker`, a repository to gather technical issues, **rainemak** created this repository and enabled the issues on it. As discussed in the last community meeting, this allows the community to create and discuss technical issues related to components of Sailfish OS.
