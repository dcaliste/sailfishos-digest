# Repository roundup

## Web browsing

* `gecko-dev`, Mozilla's Gecko web rendering engine, **mal** [backported a fix](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/171) to build against newer `glibc`. **pvuorela** [fixed some ownership issue](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/172).

* `embedlite-components`, QML components for the browser, **pvuorela** [added a handler to exit the fullscreen mode](https://github.com/sailfishos/embedlite-components/pull/106). He also [ensured that login can continue](https://github.com/sailfishos/embedlite-components/pull/107) even if saving credentials failed.

* `sailfish-browser`, the browser itself, **direc85** [implemented back and forward navigation](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1102) on mouse buttons. **pvuorela** [fixed text selection](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1103) in landscape orientation. He also [added an exit button](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1104) when used in fullscreen mode. He [fixed various glitches in the bookmark list view](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1105) (like scrolling the list over the search field when filtering bookmarks). He also [fixed some reference errors](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1107) and [removed old migration scripts](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1108).

* `sailfish-components-webview`, the high-level QML components exposing a web page, **pvuorela** [cleaned up the code](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-components-webview/pull/175) to better follow the coding conventions and [removed some unused properties](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-components-webview/pull/178). He improved how [the context menu is handled in landscape orientation](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-components-webview/pull/176), but also [fixed text selection](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-components-webview/pull/177) in that case.

## Network, communication and telephony stack

* `connman`, the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** worked on [improving WireGuard support not to quit or loop with network changes](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/97). Using `Clang` static analyser, [several](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/96) [potential issues](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/98) were fixed in the code.

## Multimedia

* `qtgrilo`, a framework for discovering and browsing media, Qt bindings, **pvuorela** [fixed a crash](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtgrilo/pull/9) when adding a song to a playlist (see https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/release-notes-tampella-5-0-0-55/21801/346).

## Low level libraries

* `nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings`, QML bindings to access system parameters, **pvuorela** [avoided different properties giving the same information](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-systemsettings/pull/51/files) in the certificate model.

* `libaccounts-glib`, a library to handle online-service accounts, **pvuorela** [removed the migration script](https://github.com/sailfishos/libaccounts-glib/pull/2) that moved the account database under a directory accessible with privileges. This script has been in use since 2020.

* `glibc`, the C library, **direc85** and **mal** are working to [update it to 2.41](https://github.com/sailfishos/glic/pull/8).

* `filesystem`, the basic directory layout for a Linux system, **direc85** [reworked the packaging](https://github.com/sailfishos/filesystem/pull/3), fixing warnings and packaging errors (like a spurious `/documentation.list` file installed in the root directory). **mal** [fixed the permissions](https://github.com/sailfishos/filesystem/pull/4/files) of the root filesystem (`/`).

## Developer's corner

* **mal** removed the page of manual from several packages (Sailfish OS is not using them to save disk space and package sizes):
  - [`texinfo`](https://github.com/sailfishos/texinfo/pull/2),
  - [`bison`](https://github.com/sailfishos/bison/pull/2),
  - [`libtasn1`](https://github.com/sailfishos/libtasn1/pull/4),
  - [`flex`](https://github.com/sailfishos/flex/pull/3).
  
* `libngf-qt`, Qt-based client library for Non-Graphic Feedback daemon, **jmlich** [fixed tests compilation when used with Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/libngf-qt/pull/11). Indeed, with Qt6, `QSignalSpy`, used to know in tests if an object is properly emitting its signals, is [not inheriting `QObject` anymore](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/whatsnew68.html).

* `meego-rpm-config`, specific rpm configuration files for Sailfish OS, **direc85** [simplified the `brp-compress` script](https://github.com/sailfishos/meego-rpm-config/pull/9) to exit early for empty directories. This saves a lot of time when packaging `filesystem` (the base package that creates the OS file structure).

* `scratchbox2`, the cross-compilation tool used by the SDK, **mal** [changed how `stat64()` calls are handled](https://github.com/sailfishos/scratchbox2/pull/37).

* `rpmlint-mini`, an RPM correctness checker, **mal** [reverted a previous change on Python dependencies](https://github.com/sailfishos/rpmlint-mini/pull/5) since it's not working anymore with newer `glibc`.

* `strace`, the IO tracing tool, **mal** [updated it to 6.13](https://github.com/sailfishos/strace/pull/5).

* `git`, the famous version control, **direc85** [updated it to 2.49.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/git/pull/11).

* `vim`, the text editor, **mal** [updated it to 9.1.1206](https://github.com/sailfishos/vim/pull/9).

* `gcc`, the GNU compiler collection, **mal** [fixed a dependency issue](https://github.com/sailfishos/gcc/pull/9) with new `glibc`.
