# Repository roundup

## Multimedia framework

* `ffmpeg`, a framework to encode and decode multimedia resources, **mal** [updated it to 5.1.6](https://github.com/sailfishos/ffmpeg/pull/11).

* `gstreamer`, a multimedia framework, **mal** [upgraded to the latest upstream version 1.24.6](https://github.com/sailfishos/gstreamer/pull/8). The various plugins were also upgraded accordingly.

* `qtgrilo`, a framework for discovering and browsing media, Qt bindings, **pvuorela** [added a function to fetch a media item for an arbitrary row in QML](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtgrilo/pull/7).

## User interface

* `qmf-notifications-plugin`, a plugin to send notifications on email changes, **dcaliste** modified the code to [drop unread notifications from the event screen for emails, as soon as such emails are opened](https://github.com/sailfishos/qmf-notifications-plugin/pull/3) in the mail application and not when the process of propagating this read status to the server complete. Now, notifications are immediately removed from the event view when reading emails off-line.

* `voicecall`, the open source part of the calling application, **dcaliste** [created a plugin to log call history](https://github.com/sailfishos/voicecall/pull/18). This plugin simplifies and replaces some code from `commhistory-daemon`. Initially, call logging was done in `commhistory-daemon` by listening to Telepathy (a large communication framework) messages. `voicecall` also has such a Telepathy plug-in to expose calls to QML, resulting in duplicated code.

* `commhistory-daemon`, the daemon handling call and message history, **dcaliste** [removed the code logging calls](https://github.com/sailfishos/commhistory-daemon/pull/13). **pvuorela** [removed some dead code](https://github.com/sailfishos/commhistory-daemon/pull/15), unused since Meego era. **mal** fixed [building issues with GCC 11](https://github.com/sailfishos/commhistory-daemon/pull/16) and newer.

## Low level libraries

* `dsme`, device state management entity, **spiiroin** modified DSME logic so that [RTC (real-time clock) device is opened only when there is actual need for it](https://github.com/sailfishos/dsme/pull/4) and closed once the need is gone. Indeed, some android services insist on inspecting the RTC time on startup. Having DSME hold on to RTC device permanently causes such services to be blocked.

* `nfcd`, the daemon for near field communication, **slava** modified the code to [make `ndef-share` tool works more reliably](https://github.com/sailfishos/nfcd/pull/19): deactivating the interface right after the final response has been sent over NFC may be too early for the other side - it may still need some time to fully process our response.

* `libconnman-qt`, QML bindings for the connection manager, **pvuorela** ensured [logging categories are in-use](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/34) by the library, and avoided cases where [datatypes are not properly registered](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/35) for NetworkTechnology objects in QML.

## Developer's corner

* `spectacle`, a Python tool to generate RPM spec files, **nephros** [renamed `SafeConfigParser` to `ConfigParser`](https://github.com/sailfishos/spectacle/pull/3), since Python 3.2 changed the name and now Python 3.12 is removing the old name.

* `orc`, a library to generate optimized code operating on arrays of data, **mal** [updated it to 0.4.39](https://github.com/sailfishos/orc/pull/7).

* `libngf-qt`, Qt-based client library for Non-Graphic Feedback daemon, **neochapay** [updated the repository for Qt6](https://github.com/sailfishos/libngf-qt/pull/4).

* `libusb-moded-qt`, a library of Qt bindings for usb_moded, **neochapay** [fixed hard-coded path to Qt5](https://github.com/sailfishos/libusb-moded-qt/pull/4).

* `sdk-build-tools`, scripts used to build the Sailfish SDK in its production environment, **martyone** based [the tools on Ubuntu 22.04](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-build-tools/pull/129) for the host parts and also [used MSYS2](https://github.com/sailfishos/sdk-build-tools/pull/130) as package providers on Windows.

* `sailfish-qtcreator`, the Qt IDE, **martyone** [upgraded internal GDB to 12.1](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-qtcreator/pull/559).
