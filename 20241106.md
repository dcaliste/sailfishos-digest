# Repository roundup

The team has been busy with fixing issues in the period. Some annoying bugs reported in the Forum have now been solved, like issues in Fingerterm caused by the large rounded corners of the C2 device, or the pulley menu hanging when the sound daemon is not responding. There is also a commit to prevent the user to enter a too short device lock code.

## Network and telephony stack

* `connman`, the connection manager, **Laakkonenjussi** [added support for dual IPv4 and IPv6](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/83) with VPNs, currently supported only with WireGuard VPN. 

## Native browser

* `embedlite-components`, QML components for the browser, **pvuorela** [fixed some JavaScript errors](https://github.com/sailfishos/embedlite-components/pull/104) reporting `log` as undefined.

## Main interface

* `mce`, a framework exposing hardware status of display, buttonsâ€¦, **spiiroin** [added led pattern as a feedback to user](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/33), this is mainly used by Jolla Mind2. In case the led pattern is handle by software, a [battery limit can be set](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/34) to avoid to high drain.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-devicelock`, QML bindings for device lock access, **pvuorela** [added sanity checks](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-devicelock/pull/10) on device lock code length. So too short device lock codes cannot be saved.

* `libngf-qt`, QML bindings for the non graphical feedback daemon, **pvuorela** proposed to [fix a D-Bus blocking call](https://github.com/sailfishos/libngf-qt/pull/10) making pull down menu to hang and timeout when `ngfd` daemon is not responding.

## Low level libraries

* `usb-moded`, the USB tracking daemon, if `usb-moded` is started when there is no usb cable connected, the initial transition to disconnected state is left hanging in transient "busy" state. **spiiroin** [fixed this inconsistency](https://github.com/sailfishos/usb-moded/pull/18) by immediately ending this transitional "busy" state.

* `poppler`, the PDF rendering library, **nephros** compiled and [packaged the private headers](https://github.com/sailfishos/poppler/pull/5) so they can be used in Chum by packages requiring them.

* `libxml2`, an XML parsing library, **pvuorela** [updated it to 2.13.4](https://github.com/sailfishos/libxml2/pull/6). **mal** [added a fallback if `getentropy()` is not supported](https://github.com/sailfishos/libxml2/pull/7).

* `cryptsetup`, a utility for setting up encrypted disks, **pvuorela** worked on an [upgrade to 2.7.5](https://github.com/sailfishos/cryptsetup/pull/2).

## Developer's corner

* `scratchbox2`, the cross-compilation tool used by the SDK, **Thaodan** [fixed the declaration of STATX function and included some missing headers](https://github.com/sailfishos/scratchbox2/pull/35).

* `sp-rich-core`, a tool to create core with many information, **keto** [set the core pipe limit](https://github.com/sailfishos/sp-rich-core/pull/96) to prevent kernel from clearing the process info from `/proc/<pid>` before the handler has finished.

* `fingerterm`, the console application, **pvuorela** [fixed margins](https://github.com/sailfishos/fingerterm/pull/9) when used on devices with large rounded corners and also [fixed an issue in text selection](https://github.com/sailfishos/fingerterm/pull/10) for such devices also.

* `valgrind`, a tool for finding memory management bugs in programs, **pvuorela** [updated it to 3.24.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/valgrind/pull/11).
