# Repository roundup

Still many package upgrades from various upstreams, which bring newer functionalities or security fixes. It's also noticeable to mention various tweaks contributed by other community members, fixing issues when using packages originating from Sailfish OS, in a different environment or distribution. One can also mention the preparation work done by **mal** and others to fix building issues with newer GCC versions like 13 or 14.

## Network, communication and telephony stack

* `nfcd`, the daemon for near field communication, **mariogrip** [avoided testing for access denied](https://github.com/sailfishos/nfcd/pull/21) when `dbusaccess` is not used and access is always granted.

* `ofono`, the telephony library, **mal** [backported](https://github.com/sailfishos/ofono/pull/46) several fixes from upstream.

* `libqofono`, the QML bindings to Ofono, **NotKit** [made usage of `Q_SLOTS`](https://github.com/sailfishos/libqofono/pull/24) so the project can be compiled with `QT_NO_KEYWORD` flag.

* `telepathy-glib`, GObject interface to telepathy, **pvuorela** [updated it to 0.24.2](https://github.com/sailfishos/telepathy-glib/pull/1).

## Main interface

* `lipstick`, the home screen code (open source parts), **pvuorela** [fixed wheel events](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/58) not sent to an application without having a mouse click before.

* `libiodata`, a library for writing and reading structured data, **OPNA2608** [fixed missing dependencies in the build system](https://github.com/sailfishos/libiodata/pull/6), so it doesn't stop when building the project with enough parallelism.
