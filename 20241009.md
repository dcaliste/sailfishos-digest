# Repository roundup

## Network and telephony stack

* `connman`, the connection manager, **Laakkonenjussi** reverted a previous commit [preventing the device to stay on access point mode after enabling tethering](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/79) (C2 and XperiaX were impacted). Upstream reverted this commit also. **Laakkonenjussi** also proposed a commit to [avoid the vpn daemon to take precedence over the connman daemon](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/80) when dealing with connections and disconnections.

* `libcommhistory`, the library to access SMS/phone history, **dcaliste** [gave a name over D-Bus to processes dealing with the communication history](https://github.com/sailfishos/libcommhistory/pull/21). This allows to filter or not access to such processes. **pvuorela** later fixed an [issue in the name attribution](https://github.com/sailfishos/libcommhistory/pull/22).

* `sailjail-permissions`, the configuration files for system-wide sandbox permissions, **dcaliste** allowed to [listen to modifications of the communication history database](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailjail-permissions/pull/144) from inside the jail. This should fix [this reported issue](https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/removing-entries-from-call-history-programmatically/17909), making the call log not updated when deleting an entry from the command line.

## Calendar stack

* `buteo-sync-plugin-caldav`, the synchronisation framework plugin for CalDAV content, **dcaliste** [simplified a bit the account-related code](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-caldav/pull/26) using an `Accounts::AccountService` object as suggested by **lduboeuf** from UBPorts. It also allowed to [provide support to the way server settings are stored in the account for UBPorts](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-caldav/pull/28). **pvuorela** [cleaned up the spec file](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-caldav/pull/27).

## Native browser

* `qtmozembed`, Qt bindings for the Gecko engine, **pvuorela** did [various cleans up](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtmozembed/pull/50/commits), including for instance the removal of old Qt4 remainings.

* `sailfish-components-webview`, the high-level QML components exposing a web page, **flypig** [updated the webview with ESR 91](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-components-webview/pull/169). **rainemak** proposed a simple way to [map the screen resolution](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-components-webview/pull/170) to the property `layout.css.devPixelsPerPx `.

* `gecko-dev`, Mozilla's Gecko web rendering engine, **rainemak** merged in the large [upgrade work of **flypig**](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/162) to move the engine from ESR 78 to ESR 91. **direc85** [limited the single thread compilation](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/166) to Rust. **pvuorela** proposed to [clean some compilation warnings](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/167). **rainemak** also commited several [minor fixes](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/163), including changes like:
 - [removing the `f`-suffix in `0.1f` values](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/164) since they were not recognised as float anymore because of the `f`-suffix.
 - [changing CSS default values](https://github.com/sailfishos/gecko-dev/pull/165), making sans-serif fonts the default, and making margin and padding to zero.

## Main interface

* `dsme`, device state management entity, **spiiroin** [added a way to block shutdown](https://github.com/sailfishos/dsme/pull/6). From the commit message, it appears that if device is powered off while startup wizard is running, glitching 1st boot actions can cause persistent problems on subsequent bootups. Blocking shutdown at the software level is a way to reduce the possibility of this situation to appear.

* `libdsme`, a library for DSME, the device state management entity, **spiiroin** [added D-Bus constants for blocking / allowing shutdown](https://github.com/sailfishos/libdsme/pull/5).

## Low level libraries

* `libaccounts-glib`, a library to handle online-service accounts, **pvuorela** updated it, both [in its native GLib implementation to 1.67](https://github.com/sailfishos/libaccounts-glib/pull/1) and in [its Qt bindings to 1.17](https://github.com/sailfishos/libaccounts-qt5/pull/3).

* `nemo-qml-plugin-contacts`, QML bindings to access the contact database, **lduboeuf** [added a GSettings backend](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-contacts/pull/13), besides the existing one using MLite. It would allow to use it in UBPorts where MLite is not used. **pvuorela** added [some minor adjustments](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-contacts/pull/17) to the code.

* `libshadowutils`, a library to used shadow tools, **direc85** [updated it to 4.16.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/libshadowutils/pull/2).

* `mlite`, the configuration storage library, **pvuorela** [fixed compilation warnings with newer GCC versions](https://github.com/sailfishos/mlite/pull/9).

* `xdg-dbus-proxy`, filtering proxy for D-Bus connections, **pvuorela** [updated it to 0.1.6](https://github.com/sailfishos/xdg-dbus-proxy/pull/5).

* **pvuorela** updated the various packages related to SE linux:
  - [`libsepol`](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsepol/pull/2),
  - [`libselinux`](https://github.com/sailfishos/libselinux/pull/2),
  - [`libsemanage`](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsemanage/pull/2),
  - [`checkpolicy`](https://github.com/sailfishos/checkpolicy/pull/1),

  - [`secilc`](https://github.com/sailfishos/secilc/pull/1),
  - [`setools`](https://github.com/sailfishos/setools/pull/1).

## Developer's corner

* `cmake`, the (other) build system, **mal** [updated it to 3.30.3](https://github.com/sailfishos/cmake/pull/4) and add support for `cmake` rpm dependency generation.

* `python`, the popular and widely used programming language, **mal** ensured that [building Python 2 is done using a version of OpenSSL compatible with it](https://github.com/sailfishos/python/pull/2).

* `shared-mime-info`, the Freedesktop MIME info database, **jusa** added [support for Abdroid package bundles](https://github.com/sailfishos/shared-mime-info/pull/3), adding file extensions like `*.apkm` and `*.xapk`.

* **direc85** created new repositories to ease Rust building:
  - [`cargo-c`](https://github.com/sailfishos/cargo-c), a helper to build and install c-like libraries from Rust,
  - [`cargo-packaging`](https://github.com/sailfishos/cargo-packaging), macros and tools to assist with cargo and rust packaging,
  - [`cargo-auditable`](https://github.com/sailfishos/cargo-auditable), a tool to embed auditing information in ELF sections of rust binaries.

* `gdk-pixbuf`, image handling library for GTK and friends, **direc85** fixed [a binary naming issue](https://github.com/sailfishos/gdk-pixbuf/pull/4) in the packaging preventing the build of `librsvg`.
