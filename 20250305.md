# Repository roundup

## Web browsing

* `qtmozembed`, Qt bindings for the Gecko engine, **pvuorela** [moved the code related to the virtual keyboard height](https://github.com/sailfishos/qtmozembed/pull/56) directly where it is [used in `sailfish-browser`](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1095). He also [cleaned up the code, removing some unused methods](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1098). He implemented a way to [always display the toolbar](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1099) (use the `dconf` key '/apps/sailfish-browser/settings/fixed_toolbar' for instance to activate it). The [special handling for download, specific to ARM CPUs has been removed](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1101). For keyboard users, [refresh with the F5 function key](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1100) has been added.

* `embedlite-components`, QML components for the browser, **pvuorela** [avoided the creation of a worker](https://github.com/sailfishos/embedlite-components/pull/105) when the search string is empty.

## Network, communication and telephony stack

* `connectionagent`, a daemon and QML bindings to connect to ConnMan, **pvuorela** [removed requirement declaration](https://github.com/sailfishos/connectionagent/pull/9) on `connman-qt5-declarative` for the package.

* `messagingframework`, the email Qt framework, **pvuorela** fixed memory management for the plugins in the message server. This comes with a slight API changes, requiring updates of [`qmf-notifications-plugin`](https://github.com/sailfishos/qmf-notifications-plugin/pull/8) and [`nemo-qml-plugin-email`](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-email/pull/26). He also [fixed a crash when searching in IMAP folders](https://github.com/sailfishos/messagingframework/pull/40) with an invalid search key. **dcaliste** [moved the periodic wake-up scheduler into the client](https://github.com/sailfishos/messagingframework/pull/39) in case of always up-to-date IMAP folders and synchronised the wakes up between folders, so the device radio is powered up less frequently.

## Multimedia

* **mal** is working on upgrading `pulseaudio` to 17.0, and updated the build in modules in the preparation for it:
  - in [`pulseaudio-modules-nemo`](https://github.com/sailfishos/pulseaudio-modules-nemo/pull/2),
  - in [`pulseaudio-policy-enforcement`](https://github.com/sailfishos/pulseaudio-policy-enforcement/pull/4),
  - and in [`pulseaudio-modules-keepalive`](https://github.com/sailfishos/pulseaudio-modules-keepalive/pull/2).
  
* `droidmedia`, Android media wrapper library, **simonschmeisser** found a [failling string to real conversion](https://github.com/sailfishos/droidmedia/pull/123) due to locale dependant code.

## Main interface

* `sailfish-locale`, some localization defintions, **pvuorela** [modified the script parsing the configuration files](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-locale/pull/2) adding a sort, to ensure that outputs are in consistent order.

* `mce`, a framework exposing hardware status of display, buttonsâ€¦, **direc85** [remove the special handling of Home key](https://github.com/sailfishos/mce/pull/39). With this Home key doesn't wake up the display from low power any more, but Esc still does that. Home key works as expected in _e.g._ text input fields.

## Low level libraries

* `pixman`, image handling library, **mal** [updated it to 0.44.2](https://github.com/sailfishos/pixman/pull/4).

* `cairo`, the drawing library, **mal** [updated it to 1.18.2](https://github.com/sailfishos/cairo/pull/4).

* `zstd`, short for Zstandard, is a fast lossless compression algorithm, **mal** [updated it to 1.5.7](https://github.com/sailfishos/zstd/pull/3).

* `libsolv`, a library for package dependency solving, **mal** [updated it to 0.7.31](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsolv/pull/4).

* `audit`, user-space tools for kernel auditing, **mal** [updated it to 3.1.5](https://github.com/sailfishos/audit/pull/3).

* `dbus-python3`, the pythonic way of speaking to D-Bus, **mal** [updated it to 1.2.18](https://github.com/sailfishos/dbus-python3/pull/1).

* `python3-trio`, a friendly Python library for async concurrency and I/O, **mal** [updated it to 0.20.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/python3-trio/pull/1).

* `python3-ipy`, Python module for handling IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and networks, **mal** [updated it to 1.01](https://github.com/sailfishos/python3-trio/pull/1).

* `libcap`, a library for Linux that uses POSIX capabilities, **mal** [updated it to 2.74](https://github.com/sailfishos/libcap/pull/3).

## Developer's corner

* `binutils`, command line tools, **mal** [updated it to 2.44](https://github.com/sailfishos/binutils/pull/7).

* `rpm`, a software package format and tools, **direc85** [removed the included `find-debuginfo.sh` and `debugedit` scripts](https://github.com/sailfishos/rpm/pull/17) in favour of separately provided scripts from updated `debugedit` package.

* `debugedit`, tools for debuginfo creation, **direc85** [works on a draft to package version 5.1](https://github.com/sailfishos/debugedit/pull/1).

* `python-packaging`, core utilities for Python packages, **mal** [imported the repository](https://github.com/sailfishos/python-packaging) and packaged version 21.3.

* `lipstick`, the home screen code (open source parts), **pvuorela** [cleaned up the build declaration](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/64) for the documentation.

* `android-tools`, the Android tools, **mal** [fixed erroneous `provides` and `obsoletes` directives](https://github.com/sailfishos/android-tools/pull/3) in the packaging.

* `yasm`, a complete rewrite of the NASM assembler, **mal** [updated it to the latest upstream version](https://github.com/sailfishos/yasm/pull/5), adding a patch from Fedora for GCC 15.

* `pythn-rpm-macros`, helpers to build RPM packages for Python modules, **mal** [updated it to 3.11](https://github.com/sailfishos/python-rpm-macros/pull/1).

* `python-markupsafe`, implements a XML/HTML/XHTML markup safe string, **keto** [removed a workaround in packaging](https://github.com/sailfishos/python-markupsafe/pull/2) to get the `site-package` directory. **mal** did the same in `python-cairo`.

* `python-setuptools`, easily build and distribute Python packages, **keto** [updated it to 70.3.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/python-setuptools/pull/2).

* `iotop`, a simple top-like I/O monitor, **mal** [packaged `iotop-c`](https://github.com/sailfishos/iotop/pull/1) replacing the previous implementation.

* `cpio`, GNU archiving program, **mal** [removed the info files](https://github.com/sailfishos/cpio/pull/3). This helps with reproducible builds.

* `buteo-syncfw`, the framework handling synchronisation, **pvuorela** [removed the old coverage options from the build](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-syncfw/pull/23). It created issues with reproducible builds and has not been used for a long time.
