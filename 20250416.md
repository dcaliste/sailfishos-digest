# Repository roundup

The browser application has been receiving regular minor fixes and improvements for several weeks in a row. Having a more recent engine is a large piece of work, but polishing the user interface is also a welcome improvement. On the network front, DNS handling will now be handled by `systemd`.

## Web browsing

* `sailfish-browser`, the browser application itself, **rainemak** added an option to [always start the browser in private mode](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1113). It is adding a toggle in the setting page, or it can be changed programmatically via the `DConf` entry `/apps/sailfish-browser/settings/browser_privatebrowsing_autostart`. **pvuorela** fixed the [URL field not being always visible](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1112) after opening a new tab. **rainemak** [changed the user agent for Youtube](https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser/pull/1115), for the interface to work better.

## Network, communication and telephony stack

* `mms-engine`, the framework to send and receive MMS, **pvuorela** [addressed warnings](https://github.com/sailfishos/mms-engine/pull/6) emitted by Clang `scan-build` checker.

* `messagingframework`, the email Qt framework, **pvuorela** [fixed a design flow after moving to D-Bus IPC](https://github.com/sailfishos/messagingframework/pull/45). It broke the calendar invitation handling by EAS in the mail application.

* `nemo-qml-plugin-email`, QML bindings for emails, **pvuorela** [adjusted the calendar invitation code](https://github.com/sailfishos/nemo-qml-plugin-email/pull/30) to the API change in `messagingframework`.

* `systemd`, a system and service manager, **LaakkonenJussi** [enabled `systemd-resolvd`](https://github.com/sailfishos/systemd/pull/19).

* `connman`, the connection manager, **Laakkonenjussi** [dropped `dnsproxy` in favour of `systemd-resolvd`](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/100) and [fixed a leak of the DNS requests when using a VPN](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/101). An option has been added [in `connman` settings to allow mDNS by default or not](https://github.com/sailfishos/connman/pull/102), restricted to Ethernet and WLAN for the moment. 

* `libconnman-qt`, QML bindings for the connection manager, **LaakkonenJussi** [added a new property `mDNS`](https://github.com/sailfishos/libconnman-qt/pull/40) in the `NetworkService` object. It's a boolean reflecting if mDNS is in use.

* `buteo-sync-plugin-caldav`, the synchronisation framework plugin for CalDAV content, **pvuorela** [cleaned-up most parts of the code](https://github.com/sailfishos/buteo-sync-plugin-caldav/pull/30).

## Main interface

* `ngfd`, the non graphical feedback daemon handling sound and vibration feedback, **spiiroin** [fixed a regession](https://github.com/sailfishos/ngfd/pull/17) caught by the tests. **pvuorela** [decreased the logging level](https://github.com/sailfishos/ngfd/pull/18) so the actual device handling the haptic feedback is not warning with `cannot handle the request 'feedback_press_strong'`.

* `lipstick`, the home screen code (open source parts), **pvuorela** [re-enabled the possibility to add fixed arguments to a D-Bus call](https://github.com/sailfishos/lipstick/pull/65) from the `.desktop` file.

* `mapplauncherd`, the daemon responsible to start applications faster thanks to preloading, **pvuorela** [removed the code lowering the priority](https://github.com/sailfishos/mapplauncherd/pull/19) when starting a process.

## Low level libraries

* `libaccounts-qt5`, Qt wrappers for the online-service account library, **pvuorela** proposed a patch upstream, [fixing a missing declaration](https://github.com/sailfishos/libaccounts-qt5/pull/4). Without it, the signals emitted by the account manager were failing.

* `e2fsprogs`, utilities to manage ext2, ext3 and ext4 file systems, **mal** [updated it to 1.47.2](https://github.com/sailfishos/e2fsprogs/pull/4).

* `btrfs-progs`, utilities for BTRFS file-system, **mal** [updated it to 6.14](https://github.com/sailfishos/btrfs-progs/pull/4).

* `xz`, a compression library, **mal** [updated it to 5.8.1](https://github.com/sailfishos/xz/pull/2).

* `libsoup3`, the web access library based on GObject, **mal** [updated it to 3.6.5](https://github.com/sailfishos/libsoup3/pull/1).

* `poppler`, the PDF rendering library, **mal** [updated it to version 25.04.0](https://github.com/sailfishos/poppler/pull/6).

* `expat`, an XML parser library, **mal** [updated it to 2.7.1](https://github.com/sailfishos/expat/pull/3).

* `glibc`, the C library, **direc85** and **mal** [updated it to 2.41](https://github.com/sailfishos/glic/pull/8).

## Developer's corner

* `scratchbox2`, the cross-compilation tool used by the SDK, **mal** changed [how `stat64` is handled](https://github.com/sailfishos/scratchbox2/pull/37) in the environment.

* `make`, a tool to simplify builds, **mal** [updated to version 4.4.1](https://github.com/sailfishos/make/pull/1).
